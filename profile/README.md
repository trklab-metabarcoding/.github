## Hi there 👋


🙋‍♀️ What is your organization all about?
The Kartzinel Lab is all about leveraging data science and genomic data to make a positive impact on wildlife and the environment. We are perhaps best known for our work with dietary DNA metabarcoding, which enables us to identify precisely what animals eat based on the DNA of food they consume.

🌈 How can the community get involved?
We are happy to discuss project ideas or share our experience in this field. Please enjoy our GitHub resources, visit our lab website (www.kartzinellab.com), and reach out if you'd like to explore research or collaborative opportunities.

👩‍💻 What to know:
Our software and code tends to be tailored to the Brown University computing cluster (named Oscar). If you are at Brown, it is easy to use. If you are not at Brown, you can gain access to Oscar by collaborating with lab (visit our website or contact the PI for more information). You may also wish to contact your Institution's computing team to adapt these open-source resources to your computing environment
